# client

Minimal A2A client that sends a message to the local `agent1` server.

## Run

From the repo root you can run:

```bash
npm install
npm run install:all
npm run client
```

Or run directly from this folder:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

By default it connects to `http://localhost:4000`.
